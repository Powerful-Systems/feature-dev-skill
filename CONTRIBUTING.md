### Guidelines

**For Workflow Changes:**
- Maintain the phase-based structure
- Keep phases focused and atomic
- Include self-checks for each phase
- Add stopping conditions where appropriate
- Document the reasoning behind changes

**For Documentation:**
- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples where helpful
- Update README if changing core functionality
- Keep customization instructions up to date

**For Examples:**
- Provide real-world scenarios
- Show both good and bad patterns
- Include context for decisions

## Design Principles

This skill follows these core principles:

1. **Incremental Progress** - Small, steady advances
2. **Persistent Simplification** - Challenge complexity at every phase
3. **State Tracking** - Document decisions for long sessions
4. **Self-Validation** - Check work before proceeding
5. **Fail Fast** - Stop and ask when blocked

All contributions should align with these principles.

## Testing

Before submitting changes:

1. Test the complete workflow with a real issue
2. Verify all phases execute correctly
3. Check that self-checks are meaningful
4. Ensure stopping conditions work as expected
5. Validate customization instructions
